# Retinal-Scanner
Five computer vision models developed to detect eye disease in human retinal images, based on a CNN transfer learning model. These models include a general binary classifier of healthy vs unhealthy eyes (with 45 different diseases), single disease detectors (for 3 key diseases), and a multiclass disease classifier with the top 5 eye diseases.
